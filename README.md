We are done with plateu, now I wrote the function to describle players (NEED TO FIX RANDOM in it) 13.12

So about this shuffle algorithme for Fisher-Yates, (creates an array of players from 1 to 6, then shuffles it. The result will be a random permutation of numbers from 1 to 6. Each time you run this program, you will get different results.) 17.12
